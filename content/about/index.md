I am Nayeem Hasan, a Software Engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Currently, I am working at [OpenRefactory](https://www.openrefactory.com/) where I am involved in the development of static analysis tools that can find hard to detect bugs in Java, Python and Go projects.

Before that, I was employed in Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh where I worked on web engines in wearable devices and also contributed to the development of Samsung Internet browser. 

Besides coding, I love travelling and gardening.

[email](mailto:nayeemhasan.nh01@gmail.com) me to ask any questions or share any thoughts.
